Each folder is identified by the PDB ID of the protein. It contains the input GRO file, the topology file, and a folder that includes all the ITP files referenced in the topology.

The files with the simulation parameters are included in the mdp_files folder; you should adapt them in order to perform:
- a max number of 5000 minimization steps;
- 0.5 ns of NVT equilibration;
- 1 ns of NPT equilibration;
- 200 ns of unrestrained MD (at least).

Modify the parameter files to save the XTC trajectory file every 50 ps. Set the temperature at 310K.

Also, you have to create the appropriate index file including the groups for the thermostat (one for the solute, one for the solvent+ions); use the resulting index groups in the MDP files.

For each step of minimization, NVT equilibrazion, and NPT equilibration, make sure to compute the appropriate observables to verify whether the minimization/equilibration is successful.
